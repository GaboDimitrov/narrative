# Narrative Development Rules

## Tech Stack
- Bun for package management
- TypeScript everywhere
- React Native (Expo) for mobile
- Next.js for web
- Supabase for backend
- react-native-track-player for audio

## Code Style
- Use functional components with hooks
- Prefer const over let
- Use async/await over promises
- Always handle errors properly
- Add loading states for async operations

## Monorepo
- Use workspace:* for internal packages
- Keep shared code in packages/
- Don't duplicate logic between apps

## Supabase
- Always use typed client from @Narrative/supabase
- Enable RLS on all tables
- Use upsert for progress tracking
